# **Cura: The AI-First North Star for Human-Centric Recruitment**

**Mission Statement:** To eliminate the "robotic" administrative burden of recruitment through autonomous intelligence, allowing human professionals to dedicate 100% of their energy to high-value relationships and expert curation.

## ---

**1\. Core Design Principles**

### **1.1 Autonomous Outcome Ownership**

Cura moves beyond simple "workflow automation" (triggers and rules) to **Agentic AI**. While competitors require manual oversight for deal movement, Cura assigns responsibility to AI agents to monitor intent and advance the pipeline.

* **The Workflow:** Agents monitor calendar syncs and communication to automatically advance candidates to the next stage and draft briefing notes without recruiter intervention.

### **1.2 Zero-Loss Engagement Memory**

Cura solves the "data silo" problem prevalent in legacy systems where context is lost between email, LinkedIn, and CRM modules.1

* **The Moat:** Every signal—Zoom transcripts, InMail replies, and email opens—is synthesized into a single, permanent source of truth. Recruiters enter every conversation with the full historical context of every prior touchpoint.

### **1.3 Human-in-the-Loop (The "Human Touch" Gateway)**

In a market where only 37% of job seekers trust AI to select candidates, Cura prioritizes the human professional as the ultimate gatekeeper.3

* **Verify & Commit:** AI handles the "System 2" logic (sourcing, matching, screening) while the human provides "System 1" intuition and relationship management. High-stakes actions (e.g., client submissions) require a manual "Seal of Approval," protecting against AI hallucinations and "speed of rejection" legal liabilities.

**2\. Competitive Intelligence: US/EU Market (2026)**

| Competitor | Core Strength | Critical Weakness (The "Manual" Trap) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Loxo** | **Talent Intelligence:** Combines CRM/ATS with a 1.2B profile database. | **Manual Deal Flow:** Underlying legacy architecture limits deep integration; users report clunky deal-board management. |
| **Recruit CRM** | **User Satisfaction:** Extremely easy setup and intuitive Kanban interface for SMBs. | **Scalability & Lock-in:** Limited custom reporting and data export risks for larger firms. |
| **Bullhorn** | **Enterprise Stability:** The industry standard for large staffing firms. | **Legacy Lag:** Lacks native webhooks, making real-time AI automation and modern "autonomous" flows impossible. |
| **Gem** | **Outbound Mastery:** Elite multi-channel outreach and analytics. | **Cost-Prohibitive:** Seat costs of up to $4,000/yr make it inaccessible for boutique firms. |
| **LinkedIn** | **Signal Data:** Unparalleled access to 1B+ members and "intent" signals. | **Context Blindness:** Frequently fails on role nuance (e.g., confusing M\&A Directors with Film Directors).5 |

**3\. Strategic Moats & Market Entry**

### **3.1 The "Superhuman" UI Philosophy**

Cura is positioned as the fastest recruitment experience ever built, mirroring the **Superhuman** philosophy of "speed, zero clutter, and keyboard-first fluidity".

* **Aesthetic Speed:** A minimalist interface that eliminates the "excessive clicking" required by Bullhorn and Loxo.

### **3.2 Compliance by Design (The Regulatory Moat)**

With the **EU AI Act** enforcing high-risk standards for recruitment AI on **August 2, 2026**, Cura’s built-in audit trails and transparent logic provide a defensive moat against bias-related lawsuits currently facing incumbents.

### **3.3 Relationship-Led Sourcing**

Cura uses AI to draft personalized messages that adapt to the recruiter's unique voice. This preserves the "personal touch" expected in high-end search while operating at the speed of an AI agent.6

**4\. Pricing Strategy (Freemium + AI Credits + Seat Tiers)**

### Model: Freemium → PLG → Seat expansion

Agencies test tools before switching; no dominant freemium model exists in the recruitment CRM space; AI cost structure must be throttled. This model enables product-led growth while keeping unit economics safe.

| Tier | Price | Target | AI Credits/mo | Key Limits |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Free** ("Solo Recruiter") | £0 | Individual recruiters, adoption | 500 | 1 seat, 50 candidates, 1 active job, Cura branding |
| **Starter** ("Boutique") | £149 /user/mo | Boutique agencies | 3,000 | Unlimited jobs, email & LinkedIn sync, basic automations |
| **Pro** ("Scaling Agency") | £199 /user/mo | Scaling agencies | 10,000 | Autonomous pipeline agents, zero-loss memory, voice & meeting summaries |
| **Enterprise** | Custom | Large staffing firms | Unlimited (fair use) | EU AI Act audit trails, dedicated infra, SLA |

### AI Credit Model
- Cost per AI action is visible to the user (builds trust, mirrors OpenAI usage billing)
- Credits roll over (encourages retention)
- Top-ups available: £10 per 1,000 credits
- Background tasks use cheaper models; foreground actions use full models — avoids runaway cost

### Internal Credit Discount Structure (not customer-facing)
Included credits are provided at a discount vs the public top-up rate of £10/1,000:

| Plan | Credits included | Effective rate | Saving vs top-up |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Free | 500 | — (no comparable top-up value) | — |
| Starter (Boutique) | 3,000 | £9/1,000 | 10% |
| Pro (Scaling Agency) | 10,000 | £8/1,000 | 20% |
| Enterprise | Unlimited (fair use) | — | — |

- The 20% discount is exclusive to Pro — used as a tier upgrade lever, not disclosed publicly
- Effective rates inform cost-of-goods modelling; do not surface on pricing page or in sales materials

### Positioning Advantages
- **Competitors**: Loxo Basic $169/seat/mo (~£133), Recruit CRM ~$85/user/mo, Gem up to $4,000/seat/yr — priced at a premium above Loxo, positioned as the AI-first category leader rather than a budget alternative
- Freemium enables bottom-up viral adoption; agencies share tools laterally
- Credit model makes AI value measurable ("X credits consumed = Y hours saved") — builds trust before upsell
- Recruiter behavior: test on side, resist long sales cycles, value immediate ROI → PLG fits perfectly

### Risk Mitigations
| Risk | Mitigation |
| :--- | :--- |
| AI cost explosion on Free | Hard credit cap, async batch processing, cheaper models for background tasks |
| Undervaluing AI | ROI dashboards; "credits consumed vs hours saved" UI |
| Free tier abuse | Candidate/job limits; Cura branding removes margin for white-labelling |

---

**Positioning Hook:** "Stop Clicking. Start Connecting."

**The Narrative:** Cura doesn't just track candidates; it moves the deal. AI does the administrative heavy lifting so the human recruiter can focus on the one thing AI cannot replicate: **the human connection.**
